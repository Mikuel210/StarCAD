## 12-10-2025: Creating the new CAD model

- [ ] TODO: Make explainatory video

Objectives:

- [ ] Increased diameter
- [ ] Bolt locking rods
- [ ] New airflow straighteners
- [ ] Only 1 rod segment
- [ ] Foam on the landing legs
- [ ] LiDAR under the motor

Today I've set up a new Onshape document for the new design. I've made a main part studio that includes sketches that other modules might derive. It also has carbon fiber rods that all modules attach to.

I've made 3 part studios, one for each module. I'm starting by remaking the propulsion module and this is what I've done so far:

## 15-10-2025: Starting the propulsion module

I noticed a circular structure might be better for the propulsion module, because the motor will be mounted on its center and it's better if the clearance between the propeller and the structure is constant.

I changed the design to use a circle and I added attachments for the carbon fiber rods:

I then added the redesigned airflow straighteners, which will also support the motor and the LiDAR.

Next, I added mounts for the ESCs:

Finally, I added the battery mounts:

I started working on the guidance module. I've made a structure with attachments for the rods and for the PCB.

Next, I added servo attachments. These servos will control the deployment of the landing legs.

I then started the design of the control module. I added rod attachments and servo mounts as well. These servos will control the thrust vector of the motor that will sit above on this same module.

15 32

Finally, I've set up an assembly that joins all modules and the carbon fiber rods.
