Today I've set up a new Onshape document for the new design. I've made a main part studio that includes sketches that other modules might derive. It also has carbon fiber rods that all modules attach to.

I've made 3 part studios, one for each module. I'm starting by remaking the propulsion module and this is what I've done so far:

I noticed a circular structure might be better for the propulsion module, because the motor will be mounted on its center and it's better if the clearance between the propeller and the structure is constant.

I changed the design to use a circle and I added attachments for the carbon fiber rods:

I then added the redesigned airflow straighteners, which will also support the motor and the LiDAR.

Next, I added mounts for the ESCs:

Finally, I added the battery mounts:

Today I started working on the guidance module. I've made a structure with attachments for the rods and for the PCB.

Next, I added servo attachments. These servos will control the deployment of the landing legs.

I then started the design of the control module. I've added rod attachments and servo mounts as well. These servos will control the thrust vector of the motor that will sit above on this same module.

After that, I've set up an assembly that joins all modules and the carbon fiber rods.

Next I've added attachments for the landing legs on the propulsion module:

After that, I've added an attachment for a LiDAR at the bottom:

Finally, I added the motor mount on the propulsion assembly and I added fillets on everything. The propulsion assembly is almost finished!

Today I started by adding a motor mount on the control assembly.

Next, I added the servos to the guidance assembly. These will control the deployment of the landing legs.

I then added the servos and TVC (Thrust Vector Control) vanes to the control assembly. These servos control the direction of the airflow from the motor to steer the rocket.

Next, I made the landing legs

After that, I added some foam to reduce vibrations on deployment.

I then added the PCB to the guidance module.

Finally, I added bolts in the propulsion and guidance assemblies for locking the carbon fiber rods into the prints.

## 19-10-2025

Today I added bolts for locking the carbon fiber rods to the control module as well

![](Images/23.png)

After that I added drafts on airflow straighteners to strengthen their joint with the structure.

**Time spent: 37min**

## 21-10-2025

Today I added some rod locking bolts that were missing on the landing legs.

With this the new CAD model is complete!
