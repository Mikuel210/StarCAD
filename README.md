# StarCAD

**⚠️ NOTE: Since submitting the project for review, I have logged more entries on JOURNAL.md which I couldn't add to the Launchpad journal. Please have those into account as well. Thanks :)**

StarCAD is a new CAD model for Starkit. Starkit is an electric model rocket designed for propulsive landings built for Highway. However, I need to make major changes to its CAD model and the current CAD structure wouldn't allow for them. For that reason, I've decided the best path forward is to start over.

I'm submitting this project for Launchpad. My objectives for the new model are:

- Having an increased diameter so that there's more clearance between the propellers and the structure.
- Using 1 instead of 2 segments of carbon fiber rods. This would make the rocket shorter which is generally beneficial.
- Using a new method for locking the carbon fiber rods to the structure by using bolts.
- Redesigning the airflow straighteners to be stronger.
- Using foam on the landing legs to reduce vibrations on deployment.
- Placing the LiDAR under the motor, which should be more accurate and would simplify code.
